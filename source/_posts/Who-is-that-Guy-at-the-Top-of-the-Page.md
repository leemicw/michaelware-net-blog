It's [Vulcan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcan_statue). &nbsp;

I am from Birmingham, Alabama and the statue is part of local lore. &nbsp;He is located on Red Mountain which divides the downtown area with the southern suburbs. &nbsp;The big joke is since he faces downtown his rear end is what you see when you are in Homewood just south of Red Mountain. &nbsp;

**Why is he up there?**

I was inspired by [Scott Guthrie's Blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) which has an image of a notable piece of skyline from Seattle. &nbsp;It seemed appropriate to use a&nbsp;notable&nbsp;piece of skyline from my home town. &nbsp;

Note: I realize if I change the theme of the blog this post might not make sense. &nbsp;I promise to keep a picture of him around if that happens. &nbsp;
