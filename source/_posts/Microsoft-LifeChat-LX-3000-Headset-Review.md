tl;dr: There are inexpensive and really nice.&nbsp; Get a pair for yourself.&nbsp;

From time to time I have been known to play an online video game or two.&nbsp; I decided it was time for a proper VoIP headset for gaming and making Skype calls.&nbsp; I was looking for something that had long term wearability, complete ear coverage, inline volume and mute buttons, and an adjustable mic.&nbsp; It turns out you can spend a lot of money on a headset if you want to.&nbsp; That’s not really my style for a first time purchase so I set out to find a reasonably priced model that met all my criteria.&nbsp; A few weeks earlier at work we purchased a Microsoft LifeChat headset for a project we were working on.&nbsp; We kind of happened into it since we were in a hurry to get a headset and that was the best looking option staples had on the shelf.&nbsp; I checked with my friend who was using it and she was pleased so I did a little more research.&nbsp; The Amazon reviews were acceptable but not outstanding, newegg’s reviews were a little better.&nbsp; Since the price was about 1/3 of other available headsets I decided to take the plunge.&nbsp; Here is a picture of the whole setup.&nbsp;

### Wearability

I give these 4/5.&nbsp; I have worn them for up to several hours only having discomfort one time I can remember.&nbsp;

### Ear Coverage

I think 5/5 here.&nbsp; They cover the whole ear and block out outside noise well, but not to the point I can’t hear important things going on around me.

### Inline Buttons

3/5.&nbsp; All the required buttons are present and work out of the box.&nbsp; The mute button (#1) works great.&nbsp; The volume buttons (#2) are a little slow to react, but I find that common on USB keyboard volume buttons as well.&nbsp; Then there is the live call button.&nbsp; It starts an app on the computer when you press it.&nbsp; I would be happier if they had left this off.&nbsp; As a bonus feature, there is a mute indicator light (#3) that turns on when the mute is pressed.

### Adjustable Mic

5/5.&nbsp; Works well and you can move it out of the way when you just want to use the headphones.&nbsp;

### Summary

I have been really happy with these since they arrived.&nbsp; They were no trouble to setup and have been very reliable.&nbsp; Since this is my first set of USB headphones I was not sure if there would be any issues switching between them and the normal speakers on the computer.&nbsp; This has proven to be seamless.&nbsp; I would certainly recommend these to a friend.&nbsp;
