So I decided to upgrade from my iPhone 3GS and pickup the Nokia Lumia 900.&nbsp; So far I really like the phone.&nbsp; I will try and breakdown some of my impressions below.

## Hardware

### Screen

The first thing I noticed was the screen.&nbsp; The colors are vibrant and at 4.3 inches there is a lot more real estate than on my old iPhone.&nbsp; I thought the screen might be too big, but it&rsquo;s size is just right.&nbsp;

### Dedicated camera button

I am pretty certain the latest version of iOS had this as well, but I did not dare upgrade my phone for fear it might become so slow I would not be able to use it.&nbsp; I use this mainly for waking the phone up quickly to try and catch pictures of the kids.&nbsp;

### Back Button

I got a chance to play with a first generation Samsung Focus for about a week and the back button would occasionally be pressed by my palm as I was trying to use the phone.&nbsp; I have not had that issue at all with the Nokia.&nbsp; I am also a fan of the quick app switching when you hold the back button down.

### Search Button

This gives you quick access to bing.&nbsp; I normally use the vision and music parts of the apps to scan barcodes or identify music that is playing.&nbsp; Having this built in removes the need for something like shazam.&nbsp;

### Camera

The camera takes good pictures for camera phone.&nbsp; Exposures in daylight are good, indoors is another story.&nbsp; I know the specs are amazing for the camera, but for me you just can&rsquo;t beat a dedicated device.

### Duel LED Flash

This is pretty useless as a flash for the camera.&nbsp; It always overexposes the shots and darkens the backgrounds.&nbsp; However, as a flashlight, the LEDs are great.&nbsp;

## Apps

Scott Hanselman has a great article on the [apps he can&rsquo;t consider switching phones without](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ICantEvenThinkAboutSwitchingPhonesWithoutTheseAppsWindowsPhone7ANokiaLumia800AndTheEssentialApps.aspx).&nbsp; My daily list of apps is much smaller, but I have not found anything that I really needed and could not find a solution for.&nbsp;

### Authenticator

This is google authenticator for Windows Phone.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a third party app but works fine for everything I have tried it with.&nbsp;

### Contact Sender

After being an iPhone user for quite a while I was surprised this was not built in.&nbsp; There is no convenient way to bundle up all phone numbers, addresses, etc for a person and send it over either sms or email.&nbsp; Contact Sender should have been part of the base OS.

### Nokia Drive

Nokia Drive is great.&nbsp; It allows you to download maps while you are on wifi so you don&rsquo;t have to eat up your cellular data when using the GPS.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think I will be needing my Tom Tom anymore.&nbsp; This is just as reliable and the maps are up to date without the hassle associated with a stand alone GPS.&nbsp;

### Rowi

Awesome twitter app.&nbsp; Remembers the last tweet I read so I know where to start from, runs quick, and have nice animations.&nbsp; This is the app I show off when friends want to see my new phone.&nbsp;

### Viperal Tasks

This connects and syncs with [toodledo.com](http://www.toodledo.com)&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the online todo system I use for organizing my GTD tasks.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; I was glad to find this since the toodledo mobile website still has room for improvement.

## Cases

My wife and I both got this phone on the same day.&nbsp; She is a case person and I am not.&nbsp; We were able to find a lot of case choices on Amazon but very few in our local best buy.&nbsp; This is not really surprising based on current market share.&nbsp; We ended up ordering two cases [one solid](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076370ZW/) and [one gel](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007634U8M/).&nbsp; So far the gel case is winning out.&nbsp;

## Summary

I think the phone is great.&nbsp; My wife is still getting used to it.&nbsp; We will see how she feels about it in the long run.&nbsp; Anyone else take the plunge?
